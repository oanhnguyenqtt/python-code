The only constant in software development is change.The best feature is the one you don’t have to maintain.A bad day coding is better than a good day doing paperwork.The fastest way to fix a bug is to introduce a new one.Roses are red, violets are blue, I lost a whole weekend debugging this issue.Keep calm and write Python.Programming is just Googling the same thing over and over again.Why do Java developers wear glasses? Because they don’t C#.Less code, fewer bugs.When in doubt, refactor.The best way to learn is to break something.Console.log(“Hello, debugging!”);Code like there is no tomorrow.If it works, don’t touch it.Refactor or regret later.Documentation is like a love letter to your future self.The best way to learn is to break something."Temporary" workarounds become permanent.Less code, fewer bugs.Refactoring: because nothing is perfect.It works on my machine!Programming is a journey, not a destination.Programming is like solving puzzles all day, every day.exxample
